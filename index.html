		<h2>Aaron Jones</h2>

			<p>I am a California native from Altadena, California. I enjoy Computers very thoroughly, they provide me with a sufficient amount of information to absorb. After all the brain is a sponge might as well us it. I tend to enjoy working but tend to make things more complicated than they need to be. I&#39;m also learning how to manage that by prioritizing my time wisely. I&#39;m in a fraternity, Delta Chi, which has helped guide me to this moment in time. I have two sisters, an older one and a younger one. </p>
